# Module Steps
1. Everyone goes over the reading for the problem.
2. Relevant information is formatted into a template to organize and build the model.
3. The model is built
   - Perform any data preprocessing needed.
   - Partition the data into features and targets.
   - Split the data into training and test sets (and sometimes a third validation set).
   - Create a configure whichever sklearn model object we're using.
   - Train the model using its "fit" method.
   - Test the model using its "predict" method.
   - Use a model evaluation metric to see how well the model performs.
